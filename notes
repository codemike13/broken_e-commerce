Download Yury's e-commerce app and find the errors.
1) Make your own js file to submit
2) For each error you find, write down:
- breadcrumbs (the file path)
example: found error in routes/users/modelsl/User.js
- write down what's wrong with it and how you fixed it.
example: did not export file out. Fixed it by adding module.exports =
mongoose.model('user', UserSchema) to the end of the file.

3) Once you think you've fixed everything, Test the app to see any other errors.
4) Submit the Js file with everything you wrote for #2
